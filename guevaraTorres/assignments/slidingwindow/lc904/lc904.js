// Problem Statement #

// Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit.

// You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started. You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.

// Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

// Have to pick an index that bares the most fruit without changing to a 3rd.
// If the window reaches a new "fruit", it would start from the new fruits_into_baskets, but keep the old tree record. Then it would compare the two and whichever has the most fruit would be returned.

// variables: windowStart, windowEnd, current, maxTree

//edge cases:if empty, return 0

function fruits_into_baskets(fruits) {
  // TODO: Write code here
  
  let windowStart = 0,
  maxLength = 0,
  fruitFrequency = {};

  //try to extend the  [ windowStart, windowEnd]
  for (let windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < fruits.length; windowEnd++) {
    const rightFruit = fruits[windowEnd];    //the fruit at the end of the window

    if (!(rightFruit in fruitFrequency)) {   //if the fruit is not previously recorded
      fruitFrequency[rightFruit] = 0;        //record fruit type
    }
    
    fruitFrequency[rightFruit] ++;           //record fruit type occurence

    //shrink the sliding window until there only 2 fruit types in the fruit frequency dictionary
    while(Object.keys(fruitFrequency).length > 2) {

      const leftFruit = fruits[windowStart]; //fruit at the start of the window
      fruitFrequency[leftFruit]--;     
            //decrement fruit occurence
      if(fruitFrequency[leftFruit] === 0 ) {  //check if any occurences of starting fruit in frequency dictionary
        delete fruitFrequency[leftFruit];     //if not, remove fruit type
      }

      windowStart++;                          //move window up
    }
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1); //determine max length
  }
  return maxLength;
}
  // let windowStart = 0,
// maxLength = 0,

// if (!(rightFruit in fruitFrequency)) {
//   fruitFrequency[rightFruit] = 0;
// }
// fruitFrequency[rightFruit] += 1;

// // shrink the sliding window, until we are left with '2' fruits in the fruit frequency dictionary
// while (Object.keys(fruitFrequency).length > 2) {
//   const leftFruit = fruits[windowStart];
//   fruitFrequency[leftFruit] -= 1;
//   if (fruitFrequency[leftFruit] === 0) {
//     delete fruitFrequency[leftFruit];
//   }
//   windowStart += 1; // shrink the window
// }
// maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
// }

// return maxLength;
